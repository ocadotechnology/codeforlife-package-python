    Wraps DRF's @action decorator to support converting an action's name to a
    kebab-cased url-path. Furthermore, names can also be converted to
    url-sub-paths. The url-path will only be set if not specified.

    Action names are converted to url-paths using the following convention:

    - 1 underscore is converted to a dash. For example:
        name: "a_b" -> url-path: "a-b"
    - 2 underscores are converted to a forward slash. For example:
        name: "a__b" -> url-path: "a/b"
    - 3+ underscores are not supported and will raise an assertion error.
